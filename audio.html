        <p><b><i>Audio is one of my favorite mediums to work with. I find it the easiest and most joyful way to share informative and beautiful stories.
            I've been lucky to have worked in spaces where I've been given the liberty to experiment with sound design and narrative, while also
            learning about what it takes to make audio sound top-notch.
            <br><br>Below are a few examples of my work.
