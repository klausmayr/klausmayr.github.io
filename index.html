                <summary>For the past three years, I have worked at the Chapel Hill Public Library as part of its <a href="https://chapelhillhistory.org/">Community History team</a>. Currently, my work there involves
                leading the development of an <a href="https://chapelhillhistory.org/pandemic-stories/">oral history archive</a> and creating innovative ways to engage the public in community history. (Click to learn more)</summary>

                    Check out some of the projects I have worked on:

                        <li>
                            I was part of the team that started the <a href="https://recollectingchapelhill.fireside.fm/"><i>Re/Collecting Chapel Hill Podcast</i></a>.
                            I led production for several of the episodes and provided editing and research support on most of the others.

                            I created videos, did research, and helped design and
                            put together the <a href="https://chapelhillhistory.org/i-was-still-singing/"><i>I Was Still Singing</i> Exhibit</a> in 2020.

                            I converted a rotary phone replica into a voice recorder and audio player using a Raspberry Pi. When a users picks up the phone, it plays
                            a prompt that we upload to it, records the users message, and then uploads the recording to our Dropbox for easy access and sustainable use.
                            <br><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2lqmh6i943xp8rl/phone-demo.mov?dl=0">Here</a> is a demo and <a href="https://chapelhillpubliclibrary.org/tarred-healing/#:~:text=This%20photo%20series%2C%20a%20combination,a%20vessel%20for%20self%2Dhealing.">here</a> is the exhibit it is currently being used for.

                            The device runs off of a Python code and a few shell scripts (<a href="https://github.com/klausmayr/rpiPhoneRecorder">source code</a>). I'm working on making it very easy to replicate so that it can be utilized by other organizations.

            In my spare time (also for the last three years), I create innovative digital and physical exhibits with the <a href="https://carolinacartography.org/">Carolina Cartography Collective</a>, an
            interdisciplinary research group consisting of designers, geographers, programmers, and historians.

            <br><br>

            Along the way, I've also graduated with distinction from UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.A. in Geography; produced audio for NASA, UNC-Chapel Hill, and the public library;
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15QaQPGT-pbRKc3ELNOt2nasepdGZtaHWpAEtnHsAY54/edit?usp=sharing">taught undergraduate students</a> about ways to study the history of urban environments; and done research at the <a href="https://institutopensar.javeriana.edu.co/">Instituto Pensar</a> on urban history
            and environmental justice in Bogotá. Before all of that, I was also a research assistant for a <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/staff/academic-a-z-listing/t/waynetwinewitsacza/">socio-ecologist</a> in South Africa and interned at 
            a <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/organization/agruppa">start-up</a> in Bogotá that was working to create a more just agricultural supply chain.
