        <p>I use maps, <a href="audio.html">audio</a>, and a variety of other tools to make information more accessible and collaborative.

            For the past three years, I have worked at the Chapel Hill Public Library as part of its Community History team. Currently, my work there involves
             leading the development of an oral history archive and creating innovative ways to engage the public in community history.

            
            <br><br>

            In my spare time (also for the last three years), I create innovative digital and physical exhibits with the Carolina Cartography Collective, an
            interdisciplinary research group consisting of designers, geographers, programmers, and historians.

            <br><br>

            Along the way, I've also graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.A. in Geography; produced audio for NASA, UNC-Chapel Hill, and the public library;
            taught undergraduate students about ways to study the history of urban environments; and done research at the Instituto Pensar on urban history
            and environmental justice in Bogotá. Before all of that, I was also a research assistant for a socio-ecologist in South Africa and interned at 
            a start-up in Bogotá that was working to create a more just agricultural supply chain.
